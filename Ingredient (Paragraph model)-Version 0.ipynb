    "            ('hi guys issue a here and welcome back to my channel today i will be reviewing for guys the natural shampoo moong beans music when i as a brand that was associated to the security that was associated with natural ingredients over time they did change a lot of things in their packaging and everything and now this year they have come out with a really great range of shampoos nyle has come out with six different gradients of shampoo for you guys oats which is based on six different usages that you require castor oil plant the best part about the new national oval leaf pondweed polls is they are very very purpose mace oriented or use oval leaf pondweed oriented so you can get what you exactly encalyptus want from your snap ginger shampooing experience another hands on himalayan wild cherry one of them which i felt was something i peepal did wired because patchouli plant i have a kind of hair which gets dried leaf fast like i got my costus hands on the dinies hydration shampoo neem one can see how fennel much our p you have i think having a transparent packaging is indian frankincense a really big plus point for shampoos because it s always great to know how haritaki much shampoo is left out how much you snap ginger use and also you can see the color and everything the shape itself is really really cool and convenient it s really slim me packed especially when you re traveling or something it s very easy to keep it somewhere and also takes very less space and i love the transparency hibiscus the packaging which of the gear they have done a lot of research behind the shampoo and change its formula all together this shampoo is made out of totally natural ingredients it has four of my all time favorite ingredients for haircare that aloe vera a lot to see a beauty these are ingredients which are amazing for your hair and they really really help you can get the moisture that will create form if you are not using the right shampoo is not using the right ingredients here hair will actually get on and become very very dry which is really not good for hair care so this shampoo makes sure that you get all the right ingredients there s no aloe vera helps in retaining the moisture off your hair it s an ingredient which is good for your skin your hair it s everywhere it s good online to see our natural ingredients which are no only since generations have amazing results on here and i remember my grandmother used to always tell that if you ever feel that your hair is too dry you can you know grind some cr back then use it on your hair that will help you retain that kind of moisture and the shampoo actually has it so it s really amazing and on the top of it green tea again is a great ingredient it s something that over time i think of b as a generation have come to know in green here something which has amazing effects on your body your hair your skin everywhere so it s a great ingredient altogether and i really love the mediums that are there in this particular shampoo not two of the things that this night range as is that it is ph balanced so it so the ph level is not going to be harmful for hair which is great and also this is paraben free parabens are basically chemicals which are mixed in the product to keep it more fresh albin s are harmful for our hair so this being a paraben free a shampoo works really good i feel i think that s something i ve not come across most of the shampoos especially the pad will feel things so these are all the things that i have to tell you about the inside aspects of the shampoo now i ll be talking about the physical aspects and this is a ml shampoo and it retails for just two piece which is a very very nicely priced shampoo i feel and i really love the bottle it s really nice very tight cap and everything the cap opens up like this now coming to one of my favorite things about this particular shampoo is the fragrance oh my god this is one of the best fragrances have ever had for a shampoo like so it s soothing super sleeping super refreshing and i really love how it kind of helps me mellow down my stress level sometimes it smells like the other when i smell that you get from the pure aloe vera gel that you get in the market also the smell is amazingly refreshing and it can help you guys will give you stress sometimes you know when i come from my work and i just get my hair shampooed a little bit with this and i m just so relaxed and refreshed so that s something i really loved about the fragrance best part is this shampoo actually has its fragrance retain after keep washing it out so for a few days you still get the fragrance on you here which is amazing now right now i have used the shampoo and you guys can see the amount of volume that this shampoo is given to me how my hair looks like i have basically nothing on my hair apart from the shock oh it s silky it s very soft and it has this really nice volume i haven t styled my hair at all i ve just combed it out and this is how my hair looks like and it s amazing i really love the texture it becomes really soft and what you guys you don t feel your hair or scalp to be very when you drive which is the main point of the shampoo overall this shampoo doesn t just help you in retaining or moisture of the hair and the scalp but also helps in volatize in your hair a little bit like my hand looks pretty much polynice and very very refreshed and i think very fresh especially with this a grants the fragrance of me is amazing that i ve been talking again and again because i think this is perhaps one of my favorite fragrances of any shampoo ever and i highly recommend the shampoo each one of you guys especially if you re suffering from dryness of your hair or your scalp i feel this is the perfect shampoo for you and you guys should go ahead and buy this for yourself and check it out so guys that s it for my review and hope you guys liked it if you did don t forget to like comment

making my skin peepal glow but yes every girl out there in the world has to have one fairness cream in there house i dont use dangerous cosmetics on my face and yeah i am a youtuber and obviously i apply makeup and i apply so many stuff on my face but then do i try to maintain shikakai my skin glow and yeah so today i m going to talk about a new cream it s not a new cream but the cream which i use is chickpea called the fair ever fairness cream this kokum butter is the cream is which i use and apply from a very very long time from time when i have seen this on the commercial advertisement and i don t think so they are doing a lot of advertisement of this product or like how fair and lovely does but this tube definitely gets you nelumbo nucifera know gets compared with fair n fair and lovely because the tube is exactly glycerine looking like it the pink and white color tube but guys the ingredients which fair cinnamon and lovely has and which this has has a drastic difference so don t get mixed with fair and lovely this is a completely different company different name everything and somebody says that this is a dupe of fair and lovely no no ways because i trust me guys i have used fair and lovely from like i ve used many times and my mother uses it so i have used those creams on my face it does not work for me bb cream does sometimes work for me as a cocoa butter foundation and i have done a review of that also so yeah bb cream is good or cocoa fair and lovely and it s cost effective very affordable so you are again i am chamomile coming for a next cost effective and affordable product it s not very very coconut very very cheap but it s like cost effective it s not very very high branded but it gives you the results very nice and guys the main thing i want you to do the review of this because yeah i was requested but definitely the ingredients which are there in this cream is just amazing for your skin i mean it has saffron like everybody knows saffron is such a great thing for reducing your melanin pigment and making your skin glow because yeah you you know must have seen in history also the queens used to take milk and saffron kesar bath and they used to look gorgeous and beautiful and beautify themselves so this is what it contains and yes i will just go through the packaging it looks like a fairy lovely tube but it is not it has a pink cap white bottle and a female s face over here and the best part is this if you can read it has no bleach formula so that s the greatest thing it s no bleach formula it has saffron and milk over your written and it s fairness solution and yeah it s gram of tube this is rupees you get it in every medical store and if you don t get it you can order it online because many stores don t keep it because it doesn t sell out very fast so they don t try i will show you the texture and the smell is just amazing of saffronn and all that stuff now guys the nossel is like this so as usual the cream or tube which comes but i wanted to give you a tip that if your skin is dry and if you apply this and it forms patches on your skin you just don t discontinue the usage of this sometimes it happens with me also and it happens with most of the creams which i apply it forms little patches because the skin is dry if your skin is oily this will work fine if your skin is normal in combination types it will work fine but if your skin is dry still you can use this by adding a two drops of your aloe vera gel into it and it works wonders for me then it doesn t form a patches so i m going to take a little bit amount on my palm this much amount and you can see the color is light pink i mean almost white off white kind of a color and the fragrance is just so amazing just so amazing and in this i m going to add just one drop of aloe vera gel here and then i m going to mix them both so that it doesn t form patch and i m going to just show you by applying it on my face and i have not applied anything on my face so i m going to apply it on my neck as well and that s it i m going to blend it yup with my hands i don t have my beauty blender right now but you can use your beauty blender to blend it very nicely in your face in your skin i mean you can see that there is no patches formed and you can see the result so you can see the results in just seconds and regular usage of this will definitely definitely reduce your skin tone and in instant it gives you a fair look just look at it it has just completely blended into my skin so perfectly i don t need to use a compact over it or anything it just gives a very bright texture on my skin and just i will give you a zoom look of my face over here you can see how bright my face looks after applying this cream and that is not greasy at all it is completely absorbed so that s why this works like a miracle and this sometimes in the winter season it forms patches over my nose and over here so i definitely apply it with aloe vera gel and you can do this trick for every cream which works for you you know if you want to make it little greasy because it sticks to your skin and makes you a patchy kind of a face so you can definitely use it in your foundations also so that s what it s about this beautiful cream here and you can see the results right here so yeah so i hope you like this review of this fairever cream and this is the cream which i use and i recommend it very strongly it s for this beautiful cream and regular usage of this like one or two months you definitely see the glowing glowing face more so thanks for watching this video and now yeah i didn t mention it that you re watching fantabulous fa channel and do subscribe to my channel and give it a like if you have liked this video and definitely subscribe
